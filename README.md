<h1 align="center">Functionality</h1>

The center of the page has a box that says 'password generator' above it, 'generate password' on it, a textbox that says 'your secure password' and a red, round button that says 'generate password' at the bottom of the main area of the application. When you click on the generate password button a prompt appears asking the user to select a password length between 3 and 128 characters. It then prompts asking if the user would like capital Letters in their password, then continues through prompts asking about lower case, numerical, and special symbol characters. At the end of going through all the prompts the generator will present a randomized string of characters based on user input from the prompts that may be copy and pasted to use as a password somewhere!
